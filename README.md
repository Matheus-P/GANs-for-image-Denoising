# GANs-for-image-Denoising

This repository contains a project i developed as an assignment in my CS degree. The students were supposed to develop a free project in the area of image processing, and i chose to develop two GANs for image denoising/deblurring, using the GoPro Dataset. The Jupyter notebook contains the two models, one uses an AutoEncoder as a Generator, and the other uses a CNN.
